## Why DevOps?

Let’s first talk about what used to happen in an organization before DevOps came into existence.

There were two divisions, which were:

Development team
Operations team

The development team worked on developing the software and making sure that the code worked perfectly. After that, the code got released and executed by the operations team. The operations team then checked the application and its performance. As the development team worked on programming, debugging, analysis, and so on, the operations team worked on the release and execution of code. Now, you might have figured out that it wasn’t a very smooth process, where both teams faced many issues in the execution and deployment of the software, for which they of course blamed each other, thereby, making it a long and tedious process, along with endless clashes between the Dev and Ops teams. So, in order to overcome this gap, DevOps was introduced.
